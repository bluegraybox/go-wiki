# Go Wiki

Copied, with minor revisions, from Go's [Writing Web Applications](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) page.

**WARNING:** This is *totally* insecure: no HTTPS, no authentication, no revision history, nothing.

## To Do
* Switch to HTTPS (self-signed cert)
* Add authentication (Read from wiki page - Config.txt?)
* Add git commit (and push) on save?
